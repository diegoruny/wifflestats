## 🧪 Testing

This project uses **Vitest** for fast unit testing and **React Testing Library** for component testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with UI (interactive)
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Example Test

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { QueryProvider } from '@/components/providers/query-provider'
import Players from '@/app/players/page'

describe('Players Page', () => {
  it('renders player statistics', () => {
    render(
      <QueryProvider>
        <Players />
      </QueryProvider>
    )

    expect(screen.getByText('Stats by Players')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### TypeScript

Strict TypeScript configuration with latest features:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "target": "es2022"
  }
}
```

Modern configuration with performance optimizations:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: ['@radix-ui/react-icons', 'lucide-react'],
    turbo: { /* Turbopack rules */ }
  }
}
```

## 📝 API Integration

The app supports both mock data and live API integration:

```typescript
// Mock data (development)
import mockPlayerHitting from './mockPlayerHitting.json'

// Live API (production)
const response = await fetch('/api/players/hitting')
const data = await response.json()
```

### Google Sheets Integration

For live data, configure Google Sheets API:

1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable Google Sheets API
3. Create service account credentials
4. Share your sheet with the service account email
5. Add credentials to environment variables

## Data Structure

This project uses **fictional mockup data** for all statistics to ensure privacy and make the project self-contained:

- **League Standings** (`db.json`) - Team win/loss records for the 2022 season
- **Player Statistics** - Individual hitting and pitching stats with fictional player names
- **Team Statistics** - Aggregated hitting and pitching stats by team

All player names and statistics are fictional and generated for demonstration purposes. The team names are preserved from the original league structure.

## Known Issues

- **Sharp Dependency**: The `sharp` image optimization package may fail to install in certain environments due to proxy restrictions. This is a known issue with the sharp binary download and does not affect core functionality.
